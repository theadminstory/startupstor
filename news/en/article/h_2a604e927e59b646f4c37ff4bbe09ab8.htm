De Beers framed the move as a response to consumer demands.</p><p>&quot;Lightbox will transform the lab-grown diamond sector by offering consumers a lab-grown product they have told us they want but aren&#x27;t getting: affordable fashion jewelry that may not be forever, but is perfect for right now,&quot; said De Beers CEO Bruce Cleaver.</p><p>Jewelry from the brand will go on sale in September. De Beers said prices will start at $200 for a quarter carat, and increase to $800 for a full carat stone. The company&#x27;s natural stones start at roughly 10 times that amount, depending on their clarity and other attributes.</p><p>De Beers had been an outspoken critic of synthetic diamonds. Company executives vowed never to sell artificial stones, and it participated in the diamond industry&#x27;s &quot;real is rare&quot; campaign. It even developed a machine that spots lab-grown stones.</p><p>&quot;De Beers&#x27; focus is on natural diamonds,&quot; Simon Lawson, the current head of research and development at De Beers, told Bloomberg in 2015. &quot;We would not do anything that would cannibalize that industry.&quot;</p><p>Related: Huge &#x27;peace diamond&#x27; fetches a disappointing $6.5 million</p><p>Synthetic diamonds, which can be produced in about 500 hours, share the same physical, chemical and optical characteristics as natural stones. But they are not nearly as valuable. </p><p>De Beers has produced synthetic diamonds for years through a subsidiary called Element Six, but it has limited their use to industrial applications.</p><p>The new synthetic diamonds will come in pink, blue and white, and the stones will contain a tiny Lightbox logo. De Beers said the logo won&#x27;t be visible to the naked eye, but it will make the stones easily identifiable as lab-grown.</p><p>De Beers said it would invest $94 million over four years to build a new synthetic diamond production facility near Portland, Oregon. </p></div></div><hr><div style="padding:10px;text-align:center;"><p>© 2017 Cable News Network.
