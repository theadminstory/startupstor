Many were tired of working multiple jobs and wanted higher salaries. </p><p>Even more demanded better school funding for their students to replace crumbling textbooks and archaic supplies. </p><p>Sometimes they got what they wanted. Other times, they didn&#x27;t. Here&#x27;s a look at which battles teachers won and lost -- and why this all went down now.</p><p>West Virginia</p><p>What teachers wanted: West Virginia teachers -- with an average salary of $45,642 -- demanded better pay and a fix to the Public Employees Insurance Agency.</p><p>The night before the strike began, Republican Gov. Jim Justice signed off on a 2% teacher raise this year and 1% raises for each of the next two years -- still not enough to keep up with inflation. So the first statewide teacher strike of the year ensued. </p><p>What they got: After nine days of the strike, Justice agreed to a 5% raise for teachers. As part of the negotiations, legislators also agreed to give all state employees a raise. The governor also issued an executive order aimed at creating a long-term revenue fix to public employees&#x27; insurance program.</p><p>What&#x27;s going to happen next: While the strike ended amicably -- with both teachers and lawmakers celebrating -- some teachers and students will now have to prolong the school year into June to make up for days lost to the strike. </p><p>Oklahoma</p><p>What teachers wanted: Like West Virginia, teachers in Oklahoma rank in the bottom three states for teachers salaries. Veteran teachers had often worked about 10 years before cracking the $40,000 mark.</p><p>The Oklahoma teachers&#x27; union wanted $10,000 raises for teachers; $5,000 raises for support staff, such as janitors and cafeteria workers; and $200 million in education funding. </p><p>What they got: Shortly before teachers walked out, Gov. Mary Fallin approved an average raise of $6,100 for teachers; $1,250 for support staff; and a $50 million increase in education funding -- fractions of what teachers wanted. </p><p>But after nine days of protests, lawmakers didn&#x27;t budge. The walkout ended with no additional school funding. </p><p>What&#x27;s going to happen next: Disappointed by the lack of progress at the Capitol, some Oklahoma teachers are now running for state office. </p><p>&quot;It seems insane to me that we have to go to those lengths to get basic supplies,&quot; said teacher Laura Griesel, who&#x27;s running for state representative. </p><p>Teacher Kelly Craig said the legislature should brace for change in November. </p><p>&quot;While it&#x27;s disheartening that the walkout ended, the walkout forced change that Oklahomans will see this November,&quot; she said. </p><p>Kentucky</p><p>What teachers wanted: Kentucky teachers also wanted more funding to pay for textbooks, technology and school programs. But what really fueled their protest was what they called a &quot;bait-and-switch&quot; move to make changes to their pensions. </p><p>Lawmakers had slipped the changes to teachers&#x27; pensions into a bill about sewage and passed the bill. </p><p>Kentucky teachers denounced that move and also called for lawmakers to override the Gov. Matt Bevin&#x27;s vetoes of House bills 200 and 366, about the budget and revenue. </p><p>What they got: Teachers lost their fight over the pension reform bill, which Bevin signed into law. </p><p>But the Kentucky Education Association applauded the legislature&#x27;s decisions to override Bevin&#x27;s vetoes of House bills 200 and 366. A compromise budget plan &quot;increases per pupil SEEK funding to $4,000 per student, the highest dollar amount that has ever been appropriated,&quot; the KEA said.</p><p>&quot;We acknowledge neither bill gives the citizens of the Commonwealth everything that our students, their parents, and our communities need. ... However, both bills provide much needed P-12 funding for the next biennium.&quot;</p><p>What&#x27;s going to happen next: A high school teacher frustrated by lawmakers could become a House representative. </p><p>Teacher Travis Brenda defeated House Majority Floor Leader Jonathan Shell in the Republican primary and now faces Democrat Mary Renfro in November&#x27;s general election. </p><p>Shell, the outgoing lawmaker, had a role in passing a controversial pension bill this year that sparked outrage from teachers.</p><p>Arizona</p><p>What teachers wanted: Arizona Educators United wanted a 20% raise for teachers by next school year and yearly raises after that until Arizona&#x27;s teacher salaries reach the national average. </p><p>The group also wanted lawmakers to restore education funding to pre-recession 2008 levels and demanded no new tax cuts until per-student spending reached the national average. It laid out a goal of limiting class sizes 23 students per class. </p><p>What they got: It took six days, but Arizona teachers ended their walkout after the governor signed an education funding bill into law.</p><p>The measure, dubbed the &quot;#20x2020&quot; plan, raises teachers&#x27; pay by 20% over the next three years. The new law also increases funding for support staff, new textbooks, upgraded technology and infrastructure, which will help make up for recession-era cuts.</p><p>What&#x27;s going to happen next: While many teachers cheered the wins, some said the fight will continue. </p><p>Arizona Educators United pointed out that several teacher-supported amendments didn&#x27;t pass -- like lowering the student-counselor ratio from 900:1 to 250:1.</p><p>&quot;Overall the general consensus among teachers seems to be that this was a small win for now with many, many huge battles ahead,&quot; teacher Christina Waters tweeted.</p><p>Colorado</p><p>What teachers wanted: The Colorado Education Association wanted more education funding and a sustainable fix to  PERA, the state&#x27;s public employees retirement program. </p><p>Teachers were especially angry because Colorado basically underfunded schools this year by $828 million, the education association said. That&#x27;s because Colorado hasn&#x27;t kept up with a state constitutional mandate to increase funds each year by at least the rate of inflation.</p><p>In addition to the statewide protest, teachers in Pueblo launched their own strike against the Pueblo City School District for five days. </p><p>What they got: The Colorado Education Association said its legislative agenda largely succeeded &quot;to ultimately provide better outcomes for students -- with the exception of PERA.&quot; </p><p>The retirement program bill calls for increasing employee contributions and raises the age of retirement for new people in the system to 64. </p><p>While the state protest had mixed results, the local teachers&#x27; strike in Pueblo was victorious. After five days, the teachers won concessions from the district such as a 2.5% cost of living adjustment for the next school year and a new health insurance contribution. </p><p>What&#x27;s going to happen next:  The Colorado Education Association said it&#x27;s pleased with recent bills to help the teacher shortage -- especially in rural areas, where attracting and retaining teachers is difficult</p><p>&quot;These bills are a start at tackling our growing educator shortage and we will look to build on this momentum next session.&quot;</p><p>North Carolina</p><p>What teachers wanted: Although North Carolina teachers received raises in recent years, they were frustrated that they&#x27;ve lost 9.4% in pay since 2009, when adjusted for inflation. Per-student funding also hasn&#x27;t kept pace since the recession a decade ago. </p><p>So the North Carolina Association of Educators wanted lawmakers to: </p><p>-- Invest more in spending per student</p><p>-- Create a multiyear pay plan for teachers and all other school personnel</p><p>-- Increase the number of school nurses, counselors, social workers and other support personnel </p><p>-- Create a statewide school construction board to fix crumbling schools and reduce large class sizes</p><p>What they got: The day before teachers walked out, House and Senate budget leaders agreed to raise teachers&#x27; salaries by at least 6.2% for the upcoming fiscal year. But it wasn&#x27;t enough to stop the protest.</p><p>What&#x27;s going to happen next: While the walkout lasted only one day, the fight is far from over. </p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s the beginning of a six-month stretch of time to hold our elected leaders accountable for prioritizing corporate tax cuts instead of our classrooms,&quot; the North Carolina Association of Educators said. </p><p>&quot;The ultimate goal is to elect more pro-public education leaders in North Carolina and to have long-term, sustainable victories.&quot;</p><p>So why is this all happening now? </p><p>This wave of protests likely stemmed from a decade of simmering frustration finally boiling over, as teachers continuously had to do more with less. </p><p>&quot;During the recession, states across the country adopted austerity budgets that slashed funding for schools, and our students who need the most support bore the brunt of those cuts,&quot; National Education Association President Lily Eskelsen Garcia said. </p><p>But while the economy has improved, in many places, teachers&#x27; raises haven&#x27;t caught up. Ditto for per-student funding.</p><p>&quot;School funding is the same thing -- in a lot of states, it hasn&#x27;t (reached) the same level of funding that it was before the recession,&quot; said Kency Nittler, manager of teacher trends for the National Council on Teacher Quality. </p><p>Eskelsen Garcia lauded the victories made by teachers across the country this year. </p><p>&quot;West Virginia will now be able to attract and retain the best educators for their students. Oklahoma students and educators will see an additional half a billion dollars in resources for their classrooms, the largest education budget increase in state history. Arizona students now have a road map to smaller class sizes and educators that will be compensated at a livable level,&quot; Eskelsen Garcia said. </p><p>&quot;But there&#x27;s still plenty of work to be done,&quot; she said. &quot;If we don&#x27;t see continual improvements in how state leaders prioritize our students, there will be accountability in November.&quot;</p></div></div><hr><div style="padding:10px;text-align:center;"><p>© 2017 Cable News Network.
