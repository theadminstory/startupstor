This dangerous law also immediately ends access to safe, legal abortion at all but one health center in the state. If that&#x27;s not an undue burden, what is? This law cannot and must not stand. We will not stop fighting for every person&#x27;s right to access safe, legal abortion.&quot;</p><p>Planned Parenthood argues the law is unconstitutional because it places an undue burden on a patient&#x27;s right to choose abortion.</p><p>Medication abortion -- available only early in a pregnancy -- involves the combination of two pills called mifepristone and misoprostol.</p><p>Lawyers for Arkansas say the law is a &quot;commonsense requirement&quot; that &quot;merely requires medication abortion providers to have a contractual relationship (to ensure follow-up treatment if needed) with a physician that has admitting privileges.&quot; </p><p>Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge celebrated the ruling. &quot;Protecting the health and well-being of women and the unborn will always be a priority,&quot; she said in a statement. &quot;We are a pro-life state and always will be as long as I am attorney general.&quot;</p><p>A district court issued a preliminary injunction blocking the law noting that it would force clinics to stop offering abortion services. A panel of judges on the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals vacated that injunction, however, and sent the case back down to the lower court to determine how many women would be unduly burdened by the so called &quot;contract-physician&quot; requirement.</p><p>After the appellate court ruled, Planned Parenthood asked the Supreme Court to take up the case.   </p></div></div><hr><div style="padding:10px;text-align:center;"><p>© 2017 Cable News Network.
