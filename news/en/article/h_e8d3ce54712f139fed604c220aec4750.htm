And it was about us.&quot;</p><p>Trump said the mainstream media hadn&#x27;t yet &quot;figured it out yet.&quot;</p><p>Trump has historically been highly attuned to television ratings, including his own as the host of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Apprentice.&quot;</p><p>A vocal Trump supporter, Barr&#x27;s revived &quot;Roseanne&quot; has been viewed as the latest chapter in the culture wars. It premiered Tuesday on ABC to a whopping 18.2 million viewers.</p><p>In the first episode of the new series, Barr&#x27;s character reveals she is a Trump supporter, a fact that causes strife with members of her family.</p><p>Barr on Thursday shared that she and Trump had spoken about TV ratings and that Trump had called to congratulate her.</p><p>&quot;They said, &#x27;Hold please for the President of the United States of America&#x27; and that was about the most exciting thing ever. It was just very sweet of him to congratulate us,&quot; she said Thursday morning during an interview on ABC News&#x27; &quot;Good Morning America.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We just kind of had a private conversation,&quot; she said. &quot;But you know, we talked about a lot of things. He&#x27;s just happy for me. I&#x27;ve known him for many years and he&#x27;s done a lot of nice things for me over the years. So, it was just a friendly conversation about work, and you know, television and ratings.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Roseanne&quot; originally ran on the network from 1988 to 1997. It portrays the fictional blue-collar Conner family, who live in Illinois. In real life, Barr is also a vocal Trump supporter, though she lives on a macadamia nut farm in Hawaii and not in Illinois.</p></div></div><hr><div style="padding:10px;text-align:center;"><p>© 2017 Cable News Network.
