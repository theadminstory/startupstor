Both men were killed.</p><p>North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said the two died as a result of storm-related conditions. Heavy rain, partly from the fringes of subtropical storm Alberto, has caused flooding concerns across the region.</p><p>&quot;The ground is saturated,&quot; Geoff Tennant, the fire chief in Tryon, North Carolina, told reporters Monday evening.</p><p>The incident occurred around 2:30 p.m. Tennant said the news crew was driving on Highway 176 when the tree collapsed on the vehicle.</p><p>&quot;It is a freak of nature,&quot; he said of the collapse. &quot;You know it&#x27;s going to happen, you don&#x27;t know when.&quot;</p><p>Tennant had just taped an interview with McCormick.</p><p>&quot;We talked a little bit about how he wanted us to stay safe and we wanted him to stay safe,&quot; Tennant said. &quot;Then of course 10 or 15 minutes later we get the call and it was him and his photographer.&quot;</p><p>Related: Subtropical Storm Alberto makes landfall in Florida</p><p>On Monday evening, journalists from local newsrooms across the country joined WYFF in paying tribute to the news crew. (WYFF is also a CNN affiliate.)</p><p>&quot;Mike and Aaron were beloved members of our team, our family,&quot; WYFF co-anchor Carol Goldsmith said while breaking the news on the station&#x27;s 6 p.m. newscast.</p><p>&quot;All of us here at WYFF 4 are grieving,&quot; co-anchor Michael Cogdill added. &quot;We are a family. And you, our extended family, we thank you for your comfort as we mourn and as we seek to comfort the families.&quot;</p><p>Related: Get ready for an above-average hurricane season in 2018</p><p>Later in the evening, anchors on a competing station, WSPA, called the news &quot;heartbreaking.&quot;</p><p>&quot;While we are competitors on the air, Mike and Aaron were our friends, and part of a journalism family. We will all miss them both very much,&quot; anchor Gordon Dill said.</p><p>Until recently, Smeltzer had worked at WSPA, the CBS-affiliated station in the area.</p><p>Both men were in their mid 30s. McCormick, a native of Florida, had been working at WYFF for eleven years.</p><p>Along with reporting during the week, he anchored weekend broadcasts.</p><p>He was &quot;a stellar journalist all those years,&quot; Goldsmith said.</p><p>Smeltzer, a native of Virginia, &quot;shot news for more than a decade in our region,&quot; Goldsmith said. &quot;He loved covering news, especially in Spartanburg and its surroundings.&quot;</p><p>- CNN&#x27;s Janet DiGiacomo contributed reporting.</p></div></div><hr><div style="padding:10px;text-align:center;"><p>© 2017 Cable News Network.
