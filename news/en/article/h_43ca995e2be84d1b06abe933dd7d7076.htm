Trump has especially ridiculed due process of law, the bedrock against government&#x27;s arbitrary denial of a person&#x27;s life, liberty or property.</p><p>Critics warn that denunciations that once seemed so aberrational may be seeping into the American psyche and influencing how government operates.</p><p>This week, Trump suggested immigrants at the border could be summarily deported without any hearing to determine if they deserved asylum or were US citizens wrongly apprehended. In a Fox News interview that aired on Thursday, Trump flatly deemed the system of immigration judges &quot;corrupt&quot; and said, &quot;Whoever heard of a system where you put people through trials? Where do these judges come from?&quot;</p><p>The administrative system, in fact, is part of Trump&#x27;s executive branch, run by the Justice Department; the attorney general appoints immigration judges. </p><p> In the same interview, Trump responded to the NFL policy prohibiting kneeling during the &quot;Star-Spangled Banner,&quot; with a message for players who refuse to stand for the anthem: &quot;Maybe you shouldn&#x27;t be in the country.&quot;</p><p>Such an attitude inflames controversy over league rules for players protesting racial injustice to intimations of government rejection of its citizens - for speaking out.</p><p>Due Process. Citizenship. Racial Equality. Trump&#x27;s targets seem to merit none of these. It is not lost on Trump&#x27;s detractors that he routinely takes aim at immigrants and racial minorities. </p><p>At the same time, the President expresses outrage over what happens to the men of his world.</p><p>When his former staff secretary Rob Porter was accused by two ex-wives of domestic violence, Trump emphasized in February to the news media, &quot;He says he&#x27;s innocent.&quot; Then in a tweet, Trump wrote: &quot;Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?&quot;</p><p>In April, Trump referred to an FBI raid on the home and office of Trump&#x27;s personal lawyer Michael Cohen, executing a court-approved subpoena, as &quot;an attack on our country ... an attack on what we all stand for.&quot;</p><p>And on Sunday, he tweeted, without explanation.</p><p>If Trump&#x27;s norm-shattering derision of the courts and constitutional principles has only accelerated in the past two years, public responses appear more polarized. Opponents are overwhelmingly Democratic. Trump&#x27;s approval rating among Republicans remains high. </p><p>There also may be fatigue. Trump is constant. His questioning Thursday of a legal process for people apprehended at the border drew scant public response.</p><p>Long before he was a candidate, Trump was known for complaints about the justice system and incendiary rhetoric. He railed against five black and Latino men accused (and wrongfully convicted) for a 1989 rape of a jogger in New York&#x27;s Central Park. Trump bought full-page ads in New York newspapers proclaiming, &quot;Bring Back The Death Penalty. Bring Back Our Police.&quot; Even after the men were exonerated, he suggested they were guilty.</p><p> The difference now, of course, is that he is America&#x27;s top leader. So last fall, when he tweeted that an Uzbekistan man who was charged with killing eight pedestrians and bikers in New York City &quot;SHOULD GET THE DEATH PENALTY,&quot; some law professors and analysts wondered if the President&#x27;s comments would hurt the government&#x27;s legal case.</p><p>Trump sets a tone for the whole country - a reality that spurred Republican op-ed columnist Michael Gerson, a former aide to President George W. Bush, to pen a scathing assessment earlier this month.</p><p>&quot;Whatever else Trumpism may be,&quot; Gerson wrote in The Washington Post, &quot;it is the systematic organization of resentment against outgroups. His record is rich in dehumanization. ... This is more than a disturbing pattern; it is an organizing political principle. And it has resulted in a series of radiating consequences.&quot;</p><p>As one of many examples, Gerson pointed to West Virginia GOP Senate candidate Don Blankenship&#x27;s statement that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was creating jobs for &quot;China people.&quot; (His wife, Elaine Chao, was born in Taiwan.)</p><p>&quot;The Trump era is a renaissance of half-witted intolerance,&quot; Gerson concluded, urging Republican leaders to challenge Trump. (The President endorsed one of Blankenship&#x27;s opponents and Blankenship lost the primary.)</p><p>If such protests from the right are rare, the left has tried to remain energized.</p><p>The stream of Trump rhetoric against due process &quot;is exhausting, yet requires us to remain vigilant,&quot; said Vanita Gupta, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.</p><p>Gupta said an overriding concern is that dehumanizing language and attacks on minorities influence administration policy &quot;The daily hits to due process are real and it is dangerous for any of us to accept this as normal,&quot; she said.</p><p>Irrespective of how responses have evolved over the past two years, Trump has not deviated from his personal script.</p><p>As he declared in May 2016, when many of his comments were rallying fans and roiling critics, &quot;You think I&#x27;m going to change? I&#x27;m not changing.&quot; </p></div></div><hr><div style="padding:10px;text-align:center;"><p>© 2017 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.
