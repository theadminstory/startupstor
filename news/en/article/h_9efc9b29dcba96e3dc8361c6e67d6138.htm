It was the worst day for the Dow since April 24.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq slipped 1.1% and 0.5% apiece. </p><p>Related: Netflix, Amazon and Facebook are a (less dim) light on a dark day for stocks</p><p>Italy is headed for new elections, and investors worry the result could throw the European Union into turmoil. Investors soured on Italy&#x27;s debt, demanding higher yields in return for taking on added risk. </p><p>The tension in Italy spread to US markets. In Wall Street&#x27;s worst-case scenario, Italy, the third-largest economy in the European bloc, would vote to leave the euro.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s got the earmarks of a disgruntled Italy,&quot; said Arthur Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR. &quot;We&#x27;ve gotten to the point now where it&#x27;s catching people&#x27;s attention.&quot;</p><p>The White House also announced Tuesday that it would impose 25% tariffs on $50 billion worth of goods from China and place new limits on Chinese investments in the United States. The move caught investors by surprise. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said a trade war with China was &quot;on hold&quot; less than 10 days ago.</p><p>Signs of alarm showed up across the market on Tuesday.</p><p>Related: Market uncertainty is back</p><p>The VIX, Wall Street&#x27;s fear gauge, spiked nearly 31% to its highest level since May 4. CNNMoney&#x27;s Fear &amp; Greed Index pushed into fear territory. A week ago, the index was flashing greed. </p><p>Investors rushed to safety in bonds. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury fell sharply to 2.77%. Yields move in the opposite direction of prices.</p><p>Last month, the 10-year yield crossed 3% for the first time since 2014. Longer-term yields have been climbing steadily as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. Higher rates dent the value of bonds&#x27; fixed payouts.</p><p>The bond rally drove a steep bank selloff. Falling yields can make it harder for banks to make money on the interest they charge for loans.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase dropped 4%, while American Express and Goldman Sachs lost 3% to drag the Dow lower. Morgan Stanley and State Street were the worst performers on the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>As yields fell, investors headed to higher-dividend stocks such as utilities and real estate. </p><p>Coca-Cola was the only company on the Dow to finish the day ahead The Dow Jones Utilities Average closed up too.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s a typical risk-off kind of day,&quot; Hogan said.</p><p>Meanwhile, a drop in oil prices put pressure on energy stocks.</p><p>Oil prices have slumped around 10% since Saudi Arabia&#x27;s energy minister said on Friday that Saudi-led OPEC and Russia would pump more oil. US crude dipped 1.6% to a little below $67 a barrel. </p><p>--CNNMoney&#x27;s Matt Egan contributed to this story.</p></div></div><hr><div style="padding:10px;text-align:center;"><p>© 2017 Cable News Network.
