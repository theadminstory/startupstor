Witch hunt, witch hunt! Witch hunt witch hunt witch hunt WITCH HUNT!!! Witch hunt. No collusion. Witch hunt.</p><p>It&#x27;s Donald Trump&#x27;s mantra about the Russia investigation, and it&#x27;s working, for now. </p><p>He&#x27;s mentioned the special counsel investigation led by Robert Mueller into Russian election meddling and possible collusion by the Trump campaign more and more frequently -- Chris Cillizza has documented the President&#x27;s obsession with the issue.</p><p>I&#x27;m not one who can often identify defined or coherent strategy in the President&#x27;s shoot-from-the-hip gut reaction policy and political choices. But in terms of the Russia investigation, he&#x27;s embarked pretty clearly on an effort to make everything Mueller does out to be about politics rather than justice, and in doing so, he&#x27;s winning the argument.</p><p>In large part, he&#x27;s winning it because he&#x27;s the only one arguing right now. Robert Mueller, presumably hard at work on his investigation, is not out in public defending himself or his staffers -- Trump likes to point out that a number of them have contributed to Democrats in the past.</p><p>Particularly among Republicans, approval of the Mueller investigation has followed. It is when Mueller is viewed as a partisan -- and that&#x27;s what Trump has tried to hammer into people&#x27;s minds for months -- that the President can try try to inoculate himself whatever action Mueller might someday take.</p><p>It&#x27;s not just Mueller. During his year and a half as President, Trump has waged a campaign to erode public trust in some of the country&#x27;s most important institutions -- the Department of Justice and the FBI -- as a self-defense mechanism.</p><p>Tuesday, he went a step further, suggesting without proof that the &quot;rigged Russia witch hunt&quot; will be &quot;meddling&quot; in the midterms.</p><p>Calling elections in which he&#x27;s not expected to do well &quot;rigged&quot; is nothing new for Trump; in 2016, when polls suggested he would lose, he pre-emptively questioned the results and said, without proof, it was &quot;rigged&quot; against him.</p><p>After he won the election, but lost the popular vote, he called the results into question again by saying, repeatedly and without evidence, that there were millions of illegal votes.</p><p>The thing is, if the Mueller investigation is viewed as a partisan witch hunt -- and there&#x27;s no evidence that&#x27;s what it is -- then Trump has won the the political argument.</p><p>He&#x27;s done a lot to keep the investigation in the news by tweeting about it so much. And each time he&#x27;s mentioned it, he&#x27;s called it a witch hunt or impugned the staffers as part of the deep state cabal he imagines is out to get him.</p><p>Republicans, Trump&#x27;s base, have responded. As CNN&#x27;s director of polling Jennifer Agiesta wrote this month, Republicans are souring on the investigation.</p><p>Here&#x27;s how she wrote about the shift in approval for the Mueller investigation after that CNN poll:</p><p>Overall, 44% approve of the way Mueller is handling the investigation and 38% disapprove. That&#x27;s a slight negative shift overall since March, when 48% approved of Mueller&#x27;s work. Just about all of that change has come from Republicans, who now give Mueller a 17% approval rating, down from 29% in March. Among Democrats and independents, approval ratings for Mueller have not changed significantly.</p><p>Trump arguably doesn&#x27;t even need to affect the opinions of Democrats and independents. As long as he can convince Republicans the Mueller probe is tainted, it becomes political.</p><p>Now, all of that could change depending on what, if anything, Mueller ultimately uncovers or alleges. But no matter what it is, because of Trump&#x27;s &quot;witch hunt&quot; bombardment, he&#x27;ll be doing it from a place of less public trust. There are two tracks to this -- the public one that Trump is pursuing, and the criminal one that Mueller is pursuing against former Trump campaign aides. They&#x27;re related but distinct.</p><p>We know the type of demonizing strategy Trump is pursuing in public can be effective because it&#x27;s worked when Bill Clinton was being investigated by Ken Starr and Hillary Clinton was complaining about a &quot;vast right-wing conspiracy.&quot;</p><p>Clinton&#x27;s strategist at the time, Dick Morris, told Politico last year about the importance of turning a prosecutor into a political enemy.</p><p>&quot;I think the idea of having an enemy when you&#x27;re the object of a special prosecutor is a very important one,&quot; he said. &quot;Clinton only survived a special prosecutor because he made Ken Starr the enemy.&quot;</p><p>And that&#x27;s also probably why Democratic leaders offer such tortured responses to the idea of impeaching Trump and why they&#x27;d rather talk about policy ideas than the Mueller probe. They saw Republicans lose a very political, public trial against Clinton in the &#x27;90s. Trump&#x27;s been mounting his defense in the same way, in advance of whatever Mueller may ultimately come up with.</p></div></div><hr><div style="padding:10px;text-align:center;"><p>© 2017 Cable News Network.
