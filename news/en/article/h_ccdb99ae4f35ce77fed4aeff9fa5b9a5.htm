We expect him to co-operate and parliament has power to summon anyone,&quot; said committee chairman Temba Mliswa Monday told journalists in Harare. </p><p>He added: &quot;In the letter we are writing to him, which is a final letter we are reminding him that we will be summoning him and we hope we are not getting to that stage of summoning a former president... </p><p>&quot;Let me remind you that the former and late MP Roy Bennett was sent to prison by parliament. So let&#x27;s be mindful of the powers the parliament has,&quot; Mliswa added. </p><p>During his 92nd birthday in 2016, Mugabe told the state broadcaster that Zimbabwe had lost $15 billion through diamond leakages, resulting in him nationalizing the industry.</p><p>Mugabe who ruled Zimbabwe for nearly 38 years was forced to leave power last November after giving in to military pressure. </p><p>Since then he has been rarely seen in public and only addressed a few journalists earlier this year when he accused his former deputy and successor President Emmerson Mnangagwa of dethroning him unconstitutionally. </p><p>READ MORE: Satire is booming in Zimbabwe after Mugabe&#x27;s fall</p></div></div><hr><div style="padding:10px;text-align:center;"><p>© 2017 Cable News Network.
