But some of the things he said are not ones that I would aspire for my grandkids to adopt.&quot;</p><p>In the same interview, however, the former Massachusetts governor and 2012 GOP presidential nominee praised Trump for exceeding his expectations on tax and regulatory policy. </p><p>&quot;Where the President is right in my view on policy for Utah and for the country, I&#x27;ll be with him,&quot; Romney told NBC news.</p><p>He added, &quot;But if the President were to say something which is highly divisive, or racist, or misogynistic, well, I&#x27;ll call him out on it, because I think it&#x27;s important for people to know exactly where one stands.&quot;</p><p>Romney&#x27;s comments mark the latest instance in which he&#x27;s publicly criticized Trump.</p><p>During the 2016 campaign, Romney delivered a scathing rebuke of Trump in a speech in which he called the Republican candidate a &quot;phony&quot; and a bully, and criticized his rhetoric about Muslims and Mexican immigrants. Trump retaliated by mocking Romney&#x27;s 2012 presidential loss and said he was &quot;begging&quot; for his endorsement during that time.</p><p>But after Trump won the presidency, Romney was briefly considered for the position of secretary of state and the two were even photographed having dinner together. </p><p>Over the past year, Romney has spoken out less forcefully against Trump. He called on Trump to apologize for his comments on the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, condemned Trump&#x27;s reported remark that he referred to African nations as &quot;s***hole&quot; countries and appeared to take a swipe at the Trump administration&#x27;s immigration policies in his Senate campaign announcement video.</p><p>But in February, the President endorsed Romney for Senate, saying Romney would make a &quot;great Senator and worthy successor&quot; to retiring Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch.</p><p>Romney faces off against his Republican opponent, Utah Rep. Michael Kennedy, in Tuesday night&#x27;s debate at Brigham Young University.</p></div></div><hr><div style="padding:10px;text-align:center;"><p>© 2017 Cable News Network.
