Eddison Hermond of the Maryland Army National Guard. </p><p>The 39-year-old assigned to Camp Fretterd Military Reservation in Reisterstown was at a Mexican restaurant in Ellicott City&#x27;s historic downtown area when the flooding began, said Sarah Lopez, whose husband met Hermond 20 years ago in the US Air Force. </p><p>Lopez, who was attending a birthday party with Hermond and her husband, said Hermond left the restaurant to help a woman trying to rescue her cat from a nearby pet store. </p><p>&quot;Witnesses reported that Hermond was attempting to help a woman who had escaped through a window with her cat, when he became swept up in the rushing water,&quot; according to a police report.</p><p>The people accompanying Hermond &quot;saw him go under the water and not surface,&quot; police Chief Gary Gardner told reporters Monday. </p><p>2016 was bad; latest flooding &#x27;even worse&#x27;</p><p>Hermond joined the Air Force in 1996 and served 10 years as an airman, the Guard&#x27;s Col. Charles Kohler said. The Severn, Maryland, native joined the Guard in 2009. He was not on duty when he disappeared, </p><p>Residents and business owners were being allowed to return to the hardest-hit areas Tuesday to collect their personal belongings. </p><p>The town, which experienced major flooding in 2016, was inundated again this week when the Patapsco River reached a record level as rain pounded the greater Baltimore area. </p><p>&quot;There are a lot of people whose lives are going to be devastated again, and they&#x27;ve been working so hard to come back,&quot; Howard County Executive Allan Kittleman said. &quot;I can&#x27;t imagine what they&#x27;re going through. I couldn&#x27;t imagine what they went through two years ago, and now it&#x27;s even worse.&quot; </p><p>Emergency responders conducted 300 rescues, about 30 of them water rescues. A major water main broke, and the flooding washed out a sewer line. </p><p>Gas and electricity have been shut down on Main Street, where water ran through buildings as if it were a tributary of the nearby Patapsco, which forms the Baltimore County border. The river is a major waterway that feeds into the Chesapeake Bay. </p></div></div><hr><div style="padding:10px;text-align:center;"><p>© 2017 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.
