The circumstances under which he was found are a subject of investigation,&quot; Hlathi said. </p><p>The police spokesman also declined to comment on whether the bitcoin ransom demanded by the kidnappers was paid. </p><p>The men had demanded 15 bitcoins, which is roughly equivalent to $120,000 in cash. </p><p>In the ransom note, the kidnappers asked the boy&#x27;s parents to pay &quot;One bitcoin by May 21 and the full amount by May 27.&quot; The boy&#x27;s family told police they didn&#x27;t know what bitcoins were.</p><p>Bitcoin is a new currency that is not tied to any country or subject to regulation. Bitcoins are traded on exchanges and stored in virtual bank accounts called digital wallets.</p><p>The ransom note also included information about a wallet to which to send the payment.</p><p>In December, kidnappers in Ukraine received a ransom worth more than one million in bitcoins for releasing their victim -- an employee of a British cryptocurrency exchange, according to a report from Reuters news agency. </p></div></div><hr><div style="padding:10px;text-align:center;"><p>© 2017 Cable News Network.
