Ever.&quot;  </p><p>She added that she felt &quot;empowered&quot; by Sykes and Dungey and &quot;and those at ABC standing up against abuse of power and lack of values.&quot;</p><p>Previously:</p><p>Comedian Wanda Sykes says she won&#x27;t be working on the second season of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Roseanne,&quot; a decision she made public after the show&#x27;s outspoken star went on a racist rant Tuesday morning on Twitter. </p><p>&quot;I will not be returning to @RoseanneOnABC,&quot; Sykes wrote in a tweet. </p><p>Sykes had been a consulting producer on the most recent season of the revived ABC comedy starring Roseanne Barr.</p><p>On Tuesday, Barr ruffled feathers when she made racist comments about Valerie Jarrett, a former aide to president Obama. </p><p>She later apologized and claimed to be &quot;leaving Twitter.&quot; </p><p>Related: Roseanne apologizes after Twitter rant</p><p>In describing her work on &quot;Roseanne&quot; to Metro Boston last month, Sykes said she typically helped the show&#x27;s full-time writers &quot;punch up stories and jokes&quot; twice a week, a job she took on because she was &quot;a fan of the show.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Extreme anything is nuts. Extreme left is just as nuts as the extreme right,&quot; she said. &quot;The only way that we&#x27;re going to patch things up in this country is the people in the middle got to start talking to each other instead of just battling it out on Twitter.&quot; </p><p>Sykes is the second major person to exit &quot;Roseanne&quot; behind-the-scenes in recent weeks. </p><p>Whitney Cummings previously announced she would not be retuning as co-showrunner for Season 11. </p><p>She attributed her departure to her tour schedule. </p><p>Bruce Helford is now &quot;Roseanne&#x27;s&quot; sole showrunner. </p><p>In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Helford said the series was looking to expand its writers room to add more inclusive voices. Queer author and comedian Ali Liebegott (&quot;Transparent&quot;) and former &quot;Daily Show&quot; producer Jena Friedman are among those joining next season&#x27;s writing staff, THR said. </p><p>&quot;Roseanne&quot; is expected to return in fall. </p><p>ABC has not commented on Barr&#x27;s controversial Twitter statements.  </p></div></div><hr><div style="padding:10px;text-align:center;"><p>© 2017 Cable News Network.
